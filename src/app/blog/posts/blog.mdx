## The Problem with Manual Booking

Local businesses lose revenue every day simply because they miss calls or take too long to reply to messages. We realized that the traditional way of managing appointments—pen and paper or clunky software—was failing.

At **allcreates**, we decided to build a solution on the platform people already trust: **WhatsApp**.

## The Solution: AI + Real-Time Dashboard

We developed an AI-powered assistant that interacts with customers via WhatsApp. It handles queries, checks availability, and books slots without human intervention.

The system ensures:
1.  **Zero missed customers:** The AI responds instantly, 24/7.
2.  **Automated Organization:** Every chat is converted into a structured entry on a real-time dashboard.
3.  **Time Savings:** Business owners can focus on service, not scheduling.

## Technical Implementation

We utilized the MERN stack to handle the real-time data flow. Below is a glimpse of how we structure the appointment schema to ensure data integrity between the WhatsApp webhook and our dashboard.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
      {
        code:
`const appointmentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  businessId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Business' },
  customerName: { type: String, required: true },
  whatsappNumber: { type: String, required: true },
  bookingTime: { type: Date, required: true },
  status: { 
    type: String, 
    enum: ['pending', 'confirmed', 'cancelled'], 
    default: 'confirmed' 
  },
  aiSummary: { type: String } // Context from the chat
}, { timestamps: true });`,
        language: "javascript",
        label: "server/models/Appointment.js"
      }
    ]}
/>

## Why WhatsApp?

Users don't want to download new apps. By integrating directly into WhatsApp, we reduced friction to near zero. The AI analyzes the natural language of the user to extract the intent (booking, rescheduling, or inquiry) and maps it to the business's available slots.

## Future Roadmap

We are currently rolling this out to pilot businesses in Ludhiana. The next phase involves adding payment integration directly within the chat interface to reduce no-shows.
