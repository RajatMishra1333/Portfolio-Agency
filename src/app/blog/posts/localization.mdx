When building a **Food Ordering Website**, the user experience (UX) is just as important as the backend. If the menu doesn't look appetizing or the "Add to Cart" button isn't snappy, the conversion rate drops.

For this project, I moved beyond standard layouts to focus on **Mobile-First Design** and **Micro-interactions**.

## Mobile-First Architecture

Since most users order food from their phones, I designed the grid system to be collapsible. I utilized CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure that the attractive food menu display remained consistent across devices.

## State Management: The Shopping Cart

The core complexity of a food app is the cart. It needs to persist across pages and update instantly. Here is a snippet of the React Context I built to handle the "Add to Cart" functionality.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="8-10"
    codes={[
      {
        code:
`export const CartProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [cart, setCart] = useState([]);

  const addToCart = (item) => {
    setCart((prev) => {
      // Check if item already exists
      const existing = prev.find((i) => i.id === item.id);
      if (existing) {
        return prev.map((i) =>
          i.id === item.id ? { ...i, qty: i.qty + 1 } : i
        );
      }
      return [...prev, { ...item, qty: 1 }];
    });
  };
